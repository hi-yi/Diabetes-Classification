# Diabetes-Classification

## Introduction

Diabete is one of the most common chronic diseases, [affecting over 15% of the Canadian population (including those with prediabetes).](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/chronic-diseases/diabetes.html)
It results from either a lack of insulin or its malfunction, imparing the body's ability to convert sugar into energy.
This leads to elevated blood sugar levels, which can cause various complications.

Known risk factors for diabetes includes, but not limited to:
- age
- obesity
- smoking



## Objective

The main objective of this project is to identify the factors that affect diabetes, which will help us better understand the disease and eventually learn how to prevent it.
To achieve this, I will primarily use Spark for data handling and building machine learning models.
